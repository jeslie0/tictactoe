#+title: Noughts and Crosses
#+description: This repository contains a basic Noughts and Crosses game.
* Goals
** Connectivity
I want to implement a multiplayer version over the web, involving python sockets.
** User Interface
It would be nice to have a better UI, especially a better way to input moves (maybe mouse based?)
